class Kinematics:
    r"""
    Base class to hold data fit by the kinematic model.

    All data to be fit by this package must be contained in a class
    that inherits from this one.

    On the coordinate grids: If the data are binned, the provided
    ``x`` and ``y`` arrays are assumed to be the coordinates of the
    unique bin measurements. I.e., all the array elements in the same
    bin should have the same ``x`` and ``y`` values. However, when
    modeling the data we need the coordinates of each grid cell, not
    the (irregular) binned grid coordinate. These are provided by the
    ``grid_x`` and ``grid_y`` arguments; these two arrays are
    *required* if ``binid`` is provided.

    Args:
        vel (`numpy.ndarray`_, `numpy.ma.MaskedArray`_):
            The velocity measurements of the kinematic tracer to be
            modeled.  Must be a square 2D array.
        vel_ivar (`numpy.ndarray`_, `numpy.ma.MaskedArray`_, optional):
            Inverse variance of the velocity measurements. If None,
            all values are set to 1.
        vel_mask (`numpy.ndarray`_, optional):
            A boolean array with the bad-pixel mask (pixels to ignore
            have ``mask==True``) for the velocity measurements. If
            None, all pixels are considered valid. If ``vel`` is
            provided as a masked array, this mask is combined with
            ``vel.mask``.
        vel_covar (`numpy.ndarray`_, `scipy.sparse.csr_matrix`_, optional):
            Covariance matrix for velocity measurements.  If the input map
            arrays have a total of :math:`N_{\rm spax}` spaxels, the shape of
            the covariance array must be :math:`(N_{\rm spax}, N_{\rm spax})`.
            If None, all spaxels are independent.
        x (`numpy.ndarray`_, `numpy.ma.MaskedArray`_, optional):
            The on-sky Cartesian :math:`x` coordinates of each
            velocity measurement. Units are irrelevant, but they
            should be consistent with any expectations of the fitted
            model. If None, ``x`` is just the array index, except
            that it is assumed to be sky-right (increasing from
            *large to small* array indices; aligned with right
            ascension coordinates). Also, the coordinates are offset
            such that ``x==0`` is at the center of the array and
            increase along the first axis of the velocity array.
        y (`numpy.ndarray`_, `numpy.ma.MaskedArray`_, optional):
            The on-sky Cartesian :math:`y` coordinates of each
            velocity measurement. Units are irrelevant, but they
            should be consistent with any expectations of the fitted
            model. If None, ``y`` is just the array index, offset
            such that ``y==0`` is at the center of the array and
            increase along the second axis of the velocity array.
        sb (`numpy.ndarray`_, `numpy.ma.MaskedArray`_, optional):
            The observed surface brightness of the kinematic tracer.
            Ignored if None.
        sb_ivar (`numpy.ndarray`_, `numpy.ma.MaskedArray`_, optional):
            Inverse variance of the surface-brightness measurements.
            If None and ``sb`` is provided, all values are set to 1.
        sb_mask (`numpy.ndarray`_, optional):
            A boolean array with the bad-pixel mask (pixels to ignore
            have ``mask==True``) for the surface-brightness
            measurements. If None, all pixels are considered valid.
        sb_covar (`numpy.ndarray`_, `scipy.sparse.csr_matrix`_, optional):
            Covariance matrix for surface-brightness measurements.  If the input
            map arrays have a total of :math:`N_{\rm spax}` spaxels, the shape
            of the covariance array must be :math:`(N_{\rm spax}, N_{\rm
            spax})`.  If None, all spaxels are independent.
        sb_anr (`numpy.ndarray`_, optional):
            For emission-line data, this is the amplitude-to-noise ratio.
            Ignored if not provided.
        sig (`numpy.ndarray`_, `numpy.ma.MaskedArray`_, optional):
            The velocity dispersion of the kinematic tracer. Ignored
            if None.
        sig_ivar (`numpy.ndarray`_, `numpy.ma.MaskedArray`_, optional):
            Inverse variance of the velocity dispersion measurements.
            If None and ``sig`` is provided, all values are set to 1.
        sig_mask (`numpy.ndarray`_, optional):
            A boolean array with the bad-pixel mask (pixels to ignore
            have ``mask==True``) for the velocity-dispersion
            measurements. If None, all measurements are considered
            valid.
        sig_covar (`numpy.ndarray`_, `scipy.sparse.csr_matrix`_, optional):
            Covariance matrix for velocity-dispersion measurements.  If the
            input map arrays have a total of :math:`N_{\rm spax}` spaxels, the
            shape of the covariance array must be :math:`(N_{\rm spax}, N_{\rm
            spax})`.  If None, all spaxels are independent.
        sig_corr (`numpy.ndarray`_, optional):
            A quadrature correction for the velocity dispersion
            measurements. If None, velocity dispersions are assumed
            to be the *astrophysical* Doppler broadening of the
            kinematic tracer. If provided, the corrected velocity
            dispersion is:

            .. math::

                \sigma^2 = \sigma_{\rm obs}^2 - \sigma_{\rm corr}^2

            where :math:`\sigma_{\rm obs}` is provided by ``sig``.
        psf_name (:obj:`str`, optional):
            Identifier for the psf used. For example, this can be the
            wavelength band where the PSF was measured. If provided, this
            identifier is only used for informational purposes in output
            files.
        psf (`numpy.ndarray`_, optional):
            An image of the point-spread function of the
            observations. If ``aperture`` is not provided, this
            should be the effective smoothing kernel for the
            kinematic fields. Otherwise, this is the on-sky seeing
            kernel and the effective smoothing kernel is constructed
            as the convolution of this image with ``aperture``. If
            None, any smearing of the kinematic data is ignored.
            Shape must match ``vel`` and the extent of the PSF map
            must identically match ``vel``.
        aperture (`numpy.ndarray`_, optional):
            Monochromatic image of the spectrograph aperture. See
            ``psf`` for how this is used.
        binid (`numpy.ndarray`_, optional):
            Integer array associating each measurement with a unique
            bin number. Measurements not associated with any bin
            should have a value of -1 in this array. If None, all
            (unmasked) measurements are considered unique.
        grid_x (`numpy.ndarray`_, optional):
            The on-sky Cartesian :math:`x` coordinates of *each*
            element in the data grid. If the data are unbinned, this
            array is identical to `x` (except that *every* value
            should be valid). This argument is *required* if
            ``binid`` is provided.
        grid_y (`numpy.ndarray`_, optional):
            The on-sky Cartesian :math:`y` coordinates of *each*
            element in the data grid. See the description of
            ``grid_x``.
        grid_sb (`numpy.ndarray`_, optional):
            The relative surface brightness of the kinematic tracer over the
            full coordinate grid.  If None, this is either assumed to be unity
            or set by the provided ``sb``.  When fitting the data with, e.g., 
            :class:`~nirvana.model.axisym.AxisymmetricDisk` via the ``sb_wgt``
            parameter in its fitting method, this will be the weighting used.
            The relevance of this array is to enable the weighting used in
            constructing the model velocity field to be *unbinned* for otherwise
            binned kinematic data.
        grid_wcs (`astropy.wcs.WCS`_, optional):
            World coordinate system for the on-sky grid. Currently, this is
            only used for output files.
        reff (:obj:`float`, optional):
            Effective radius in same units as :attr:`x` and :attr:`y`.
        fwhm (:obj:`float`, optional):
            The FWHM of the PSF of the galaxy in the same units as :attr:`x` and
            :attr:`y`.
        image (`numpy.ndarray`_, optional):
            Galaxy image, typically from a PNG, and only used for plotting.  For
            format, see matplotlib.images.imread.
        phot_inc (:obj:`float`, optional):
            Photometric inclination in degrees.
        phot_pa (:obj:`float`, optional):
            Photometric position angle in degrees.
        maxr (:obj:`float`, optional):
            Maximum radius of useful data in effective radii.
        positive_definite (:obj:`bool`, optional):
            Use :func:`~nirvana.data.util.impose_positive_definite` to force
            the provided covariance matrix to be positive definite.
        quiet (:obj:`bool`, optional):
            Suppress message output.

        Draw Gaussian deviates from the velocity and velocity dispersion error
        distributions.

        This is basically a wrapper for
        :func:`~nirvana.data.util.gaussian_deviates`.  One deviate is drawn for
        each of the valid velocity and velocity dispersion measurements.
        Multiple sets of deviates can be drawn using ``size``.

        This function is primarily for use with mock observations.  For example,
        if you have a :class:`Kinematics` object (``kin``) with an observed set
        of data, you can generate a mock dataset based on the
        :class:`~nirvana.models.axisym.AxisymmetricDisk`::

            import numpy
            from nirvana.models.oned import HyperbolicTangent, Exponential
            from nirvana.models.axisym import AxisymmetricDisk

            noisefree_mock = disk.mock_observation(p0, kin=kin)

        And then generate deviates using this method and add them to a new
        kinematics object::

            # Generate 10 sets of deviates
            vgpm, dv, sgpm, ds \
                    = noisefree_mock.deviate(size=10, sigma='ignore' if disk.dc is None else 'draw')

                instantiated.
            sigma (:obj:`str`, optional):
                Treatment for the velocity dispersion.  Options are:

                    - 'draw': Draw Gaussian deviates from ``sig_ivar`` or
                      ``sig_covar``, if they exist.
                    - 'drawsqr': Draw Gaussian deviates from ``sig_phys2_ivar``
                      or ``sig_phys2_covar``, if they exist.
                    - 'ignore': Do not draw any deviates for the dispersion,
                      even if the error distributions exist.
                
        Returns:
            :obj:`tuple`: Good-value masks and deviates for the velocity and
            velocity dispersion, respectively.  If neither :attr:`vel_ivar` nor

            similarly for the second two objects if dispersion errors are not
            available or ignored.  The shape of the good pixel masks is always
            the same as the internal velocity and dispersion arrays.  The shape
            of the returned deviate arrays is ``(size,n_good)``, where ``size``
            is the provided keyword argument and ``n_good`` is the number of
            valid kinematic measurements.
