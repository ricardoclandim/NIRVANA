def asymmetry(args, pa, vsys, xc=0, yc=0, maxd=.5):
    '''
    Calculate global asymmetry parameter and map of asymmetry.

    Using Equation 7 from Andersen & Bershady (2007), the symmetry of a galaxy
    is calculated. This is done by reflecting it across the supplied position
    angle (assumed to be the major axis) and the angle perpendicular to that
    (assumed to be the minor axis). The value calculated is essentially a
    normalized error weighted difference between the velocity measurements on
    either side of a reflecting line. 

    The function tries to find the nearest neighbor to a spaxel's reflected
    coordinates. If the distance is too far, the spaxel is masked.

    The returned value is the mean of the sums of all of the normalized
    asymmetries over the whole velocity field for the major and minor axes and
    should scale between 0 and 1, wih 0 being totally symmetrical and 1 being
    totally asymmetrical. The map is the average of the asymmetry maps for the
    major and minor axes.

            x position of the center of the velocity field. Must be in the same
            units as `args.x`.

            y position of the center of the velocity field. Must be in the same

            Maximum distance to allow the nearest neighbor finding to look for
            a reflexted spaxel. Any neighbor pairs at a radius larger than this
            will be masked. Must be in the same units as the spatial
            coordinates `args.x` and `args.y`.

def symmetric_reflection_map(x, y, rotation=None, reflect='all'):
    r"""
    For each input coordinate, find the distance to the nearest pixel and its
    index after reflecting about an axis.

    This is primarily used to construct asymmetry measurements.  Instead of
    interpolating new data, this returns the pixel indices so that they can be
    used to propagate covariance between pixels.  The axis for the reflection
    crosses through :math:`(x,y) = (0,0)` with a counter-clockwise rotation
    provided by ``rotation``.

    The allowed reflections are:

        #. ``None``: No reflections are performed.
        #. ``'x'``: Reflects the data about the (rotated) :math:`y=0` axis.
        #. ``'y'``: Reflects the data about the (rotated) :math:`x=0` axis.
        #. ``'xy'``: Reflects the data about both the (rotated) :math:`x=0` and
           :math:`y=0` axes.  Note this is the same as rotating by 180 deg and
           applying no reflection.
        #. ``'all'``: Perform all four of the above.  The order is same as 1-4
           above.

    The returned objects provide the distance between the mapped pixels and the
    index of the coordinate nearest each input coordinate after being reflected
    about the provided axis.  Note that ``reflect=None`` should produce the
    trivial result that:

    .. code-block:: python

        d, i = symmetric_reflection_map(x, y, reflect=None)
        assert np.array_equal(i, np.arange(x.size))

    To compare an original set of data and its reflected, e.g.:

    .. code-block:: python

        d, i = symmetric_reflection_map(x, y)
        data_reflected_about_x = data[i[1]]

    where ``x`` and ``y`` are the Cartesian coordinates for the measurements
    provided by ``data``.
    
    Inspired by ``symmetrize_velfield`` in M. Cappellari's `plotbin`_ package.

    Args:
        x (`numpy.ndarray`_):
            The vector of Cartesian :math:`x` coordinates.  Must be 1D.
        y (`numpy.ndarray`_):
            The vector of Cartesian :math:`y` coordinates.  Must have the same
            shape as ``x``.
        rotation (:obj:`float`, optional):
            In the frame of the provided coordinate system, this is the
            counter-clockwise rotation of the new Cartesian :math:`x` axis to
            use for the reflections.
        reflect (:obj:`str`, :obj:`list`, optional):
            The type of reflections to apply.  See descriptions above.  Multiple
            reflections can be applied using a list of strings, however
            ``'all'`` cannot be an element of the list.  If a list is provided,
            the order of the reflections is maintained in the returned array(s).

    Returns:
        :obj:`tuple`: Returns two `numpy.ndarray`_ objects, the distance between
        the input pixels and the pixel nearest to its reflected location and the
        index of the nearest pixel.  See the function description.  If multiple
        reflections are requested, they are ordered along the first axis of the
        return arrays.  For example, if ``reflect=[None, 'x']``, the shape of
        the arrays are ``(2,x.size)``, and the matching indices when reflected
        about the (rotated) :math:`x` axis is the 2nd entry in the first axis.

    Compute the difference between the data and axial reflections of itself to
    measure non-axisymmetries.

    The axis of reflection is given by the provided position angle (from N
    through E in degrees) defined as being along the Cartesian :math:`y` axis of
    the reflected frame.  The reflections are performed by
    :func:`symmetric_reflection_map`.  Typically the PA is along the major axis
    of a galaxy, such that the reflections are, respectively, about the major
    axis, about the minor axis, and about both (the same as a 180 degree
    rotation).

    The data can have an "odd" or "even" symmetry; see the ``odd`` argument.

    .. warning::

        The function performs the difference computations using matrix
        multiplication.  This simplifies propagation of errors, but it also
        means that data subtracted from themselves are *ignored*.  I.e., any
        pixel matched to itself in the reflection symmetry mapping is
        effectively masked in the calculation; the difference values, *as well
        as any propagated error*, will be 0.

            coordinate system.
        ivar (`numpy.ndarray`_, optional):
            The inverse variance in the provided data.  If provided, must have
            the same shape as ``x``.

            Covariance matrix for the provided data.  If both this and ``ivar``
            are provided, the provided covariance takes precedence.  The shape
            of the matrix must be :math:`(N_{\rm pix}, N_{\rm pix})` where

            ``x`` and ``y``.

            symmetry such that :math:`f(x,-y) = -f(x,y)`.  For example, velocity
            fields have odd symmetry, but velocity dispersion fields have even
            symmetry.
